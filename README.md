This repository contains step 2 of the source code for the Simple Capture Demo app by Socket Mobile for Android. 

This phase of Simple Capture Demo builds upon the first phase, and shows how to integrate and start the Capture SDK client component in an Android application.


### System information ###

* Requires Socket Mobile Companion version 1.3.58 or higher (available on the Google Play Store) 
* Developed on a Mac Mini using Visual Studio for Mac


### How to use the app ###

Download and install the Socket Mobile Companion from the Google Play Store. (This demo program does not require you to run the Companion app or to have a paired scanner.) Then, compile and run the Simple Capture Demo application on your target device.

This application shows how to get the Capture servcie and client (CaptureHelper) up and running. There is practically no user interface in this application. To confirm it is working, a toast notification will report the client initialization return code, and the retry count that was needed to get the client started.


### License and agreement ###

The app integrates Socket Mobile Capture SDK and is free for adaptation per your own business needs under Socket Mobile license and user agreements. You will need to join the Socket Mobile Developer program to access the SDK and create AppKeys for your own applications. The Socket Mobile Developer program is free for life with a one time registration fee.
